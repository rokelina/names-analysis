### Names datasets from people born in the US, Spain, Argentina, Chile and Italy.

I started this project as a way to learn how to manipulate and clean data with python.

Some concepts I learnt though this project:

- Reading and writing csv files with pythonâ€™s csv module
- Web scraping with `beautiful soup`
- Manipulate excel files with `openpyxl`
- Create and instantiate data classes
- Type hints

I made these datasets available on Kaggle
